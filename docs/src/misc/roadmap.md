The strategy is to implement paradigms very broadly at first to test the core concepts of beet for flexibility.


| Descrition                     | Status |
| ------------------------------ | ------ |
| Behavior Trees - Sequences etc | âœ…      |
| Utility AI - Score Selectors   | âœ…      |
| LLM - Sentence Scorer          | âœ…      |
| Robotics - esp32 Example       | âœ…      |
| Pathfinding/search (a* etc)    | ðŸš§      |
| State Trees (transitions)      | ðŸš§      |
| Reinforcement Learning         | ðŸš§      |
| GOAP (runtime tree generators) | ðŸ¤·      |

- âœ… at least a proof of concept
- ðŸš§ planned
- ðŸ¤· it'd be cool but haven't thought about it
