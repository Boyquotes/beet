Bevy is a remarkably versatile engine, it can run on tiny microcontrollers like the ESP32.

## But why use a game engine?

- Simulation: We get a deeply integrated simulation environment out of the box
- Ecosystem: Share and reuse editors, netcode, animations, behaviors etc
- ECS beyond games: ECS is very well suited to performance critical robotics applications
