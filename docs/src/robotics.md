# Robotics

Bevy is a remarkably versatile engine, it can run on tiny microcontrollers like the ESP32.

## But why use a game engine?

Just because we *can* run bevy on a microntroller, should we? Yes I think so and here's a few reasons why:

- Simulation: We get a simulation environment out of the box
- Ecosystem: Share and reuse libraries like netcode, navigation or behavior selection
- Animation: Bringing robotics tooling closer to skilled animators is an important step toward quality human interaction
- ECS beyond games: Its a really nice architectural pattern, and performance is also critical in robotics
